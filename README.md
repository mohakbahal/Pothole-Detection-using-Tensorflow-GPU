### [TRY it out for Yourself]:
1.) Make sure you have certain libraries pre-installed to make this code run namely: 'Tensorflow' , 'Keras' , 'Matplotlib' , etc. (I personally prefer conda).
2.) Download all the files from this repository (Clone/Download).
2.) Use any IDE or Jupyter Notebook (as per your desire and ease).
3.) Copy the block of code mentioned below to load the model.
4.) Simply run and feel blessed xD.
5.) You could try with any other test image as per your wish, make sure you have the image downloaded in the parent directory(in which the code is placed), furthermore remember to rename the file_name in the test_image line of code and also in the visualization segment(img , the matlab part).
