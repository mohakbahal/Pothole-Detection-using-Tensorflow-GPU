## A Custom Model trained to detect Pothole in images!

#### Running **100 epochs** over **538** training images which involved **264** under each 'Pothole' and 'Normal' label using my **GPU**[NVIDIA GEFORCE 940MX] ! 
#### The accuracy achieved after executing these many epochs was **98.30%** and the validation accuracy i got was **89.06%**.
#### I have the model and the json files which could be directly used by users to look into the result part by loading an image of your own choice!
